            <p>
               Here at FaceZonGoogAppFlix, we create software to help everyone code. We want to make free, and
               open source software, with the users privacy in mind. Here at FaceZonGoogAppFlix, we have made
               multiple pieces of software from IDE's to Virtual Assistants. <br />
               This website is to teach people how to code. You can navigate to our <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&t=3s">courses</a>
               to start learing. We will be learning HTML and CSS, which is great for beginners.

            <h2>Why learn to code?</h2>
            <p>
               Coding is the new literacy. It is such a helpful skill in the new world. 
               You can create anything you want, your imagination is the only limit. You can make a website,
               applications, games, or anything else you want. 
               Coding can also boost your logic skills, along with looking very good on your resume, and boost skills
               needed for jobs. Coding can also improve skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, and 
               creativity.
